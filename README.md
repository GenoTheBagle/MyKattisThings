# Kattis Projects
All code written here was made by me, with little* reference to the works of others

Also, all code written here is for projects from [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)

Code is all simply plonked into the Src folder. Organizing by difficulty was weird

I may be slow but that doesn't stop me from figuring out Kattis questions in the worst way possible ðŸ¦•

> [!NOTE]
> I only reference others when I get really really stuck, stackoverflow doesn't count imo
