# Kattis Projects
All code written here was made by me, with no reference to the works of others

Also, all code written here is for projects from [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)

Code written is organized in Easy, Medium and Hard. If they change, that's too bad, because it took me a long time to put everything in the folders

I may be slow but that doesn't stop me from figuring out Kattis questions in the worst way possible ðŸ¦•
